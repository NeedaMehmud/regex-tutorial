Welcome to Regex Tutorial! What is Regex? Let's hop on to the summary section below to get to know it more.

## Summary

Regex stands for a regular expression. It is a special text string for describing a search pattern. You can think of regular expressions as wildcards on steroids. You are probably familiar with wildcard notations such as *.txt to find all text files in a file manager. The regex equivalent is ^.*\.txt$. Cool, right? 

In this tutorial we will be using the most common regular expression: an e-mail address.
